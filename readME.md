// function expressions vs. function declarations (assigned to variable)

// declarations load before any code is executed before any code is executed, expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. 

// function declarations are hoisted to the top of other code. expressions aren't hoisted, which allows them to retain a copy of the local variables from the scope where they were defined.

// several ways that functions expressions are more useful than function expressions:

// as closures, as arguments to other functions, as immediately invoked function expressions - IIFE
